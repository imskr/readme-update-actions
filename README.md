## Usage

1. Go to your repository
2. Add the following section to your **README.md** file, you can give whatever title you want. Just make sure that you use `<!-- BLOG-LIST-START --><!-- BLOG-LIST-END -->` in your readme. The workflow will replace this comment with the actual blog post list:

    ```markdown
    # Blog posts
    <!-- BLOG-LIST-START -->
    <!-- BLOG-LIST-END -->
    ```

3. Create a folder `.github/workflows` inside root of the repository if it doesn't exists.
4. Create a new file `readme-update-actions.yml`  inside `.github/workflows/`  with the following contents:

    ```yaml
    name: Readme Update Blog
    on:
      schedule: # Run workflow automatically
        - cron: '0 * * * *' # Runs every hour, on the hour
      workflow_dispatch: # Run workflow manually (without waiting for the cron to be called), through the GitHub Actions Workflow page directly
    
    jobs:
      readme-update-blogs:
        name: Update this repo's README with latest blog posts
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Pull in medium.com posts
            uses: imskr/readme-update-actions@v1
            with:
              rss_list: "https://imskr.medium.com/feed"
    ```

5. Replace the above URL list with your own RSS feed URLs.
6. Commit and wait for it to run automatically, or you can also trigger it manually to see the result instantly.
